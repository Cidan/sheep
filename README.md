## Sheep?

Sheep is a distributed, idempotent, and eventually consistent counter service backed by different backends. When properly configured, sheep will **guarantee** accurate counts.

Backends are pluggable, with current support for Google Spanner and CockroachDB on the storage side, and with Google Pub/Sub and RabbitMQ support on the transport side.
